\abstract{
\textbf{Motivation:} Genome browsers are an essential tool in genome
analysis. Modern genome browsers enable complex and interactive
visualization of a wide variety of genomic data modalities. While such
browsers are very powerful, they can be challenging to configure and
program for bioinformaticians lacking expertise in web development.\\
\textbf{Results:} We have developed an R package that provides an
interface to the JBrowse 2 genome browser. The package can be used to
configure and customize the browser entirely with R code. The browser
can be deployed from the R console, or embedded in Shiny applications or
R Markdown documents.\\
\textbf{Availability:} JBrowseR is available for download from CRAN, and
the source code is openly available from the Github repository at\\
\textbf{Contact:}ihh@berkeley.edu\\
\textbf{Supplementary information:} Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics Online.}

\section{Approach}

Here is how to include math equations in the document (bounded by
\texttt{\$\$}):

\[
\begin{aligned}
(x+y)^3&=(x+y)(x+y)^2\\
       &=(x+y)(x^2+2xy+y^2) \label{eqn:example} \\
       &=x^3+3x^2y+3xy^3+x^3. 
\end{aligned}
\]
